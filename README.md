# CitiBike Usage analysis

The purpose of this study was to glean information that will help with decisionmaking when implementing the CitiBike bike rental format in Des Moines, Iowa. The metrics in question were: duration of bike rental, busiest checkout times, checkout times sorted by gender, and the ratio of one-time users to subscribers (also sorted by gender). 

[The Tableau story can be found here.](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/charles.rank/viz/CitiBike_Story_16492762294280/Story1?publish=yes) This story was generated using Tableau, and the data was previously examined and cleaned using Python. The source code for that is also included in the repository. 

For future visualization, I would suggest comparing public transit coverage with trip starting points. Are customers using the service as a last-mile method of transportation, and if so could that imply that they would have longer overall trips in a city like Des Moines which has less robust transit coverage than New York? This is a question that could be answered by such a visualization.
